You are a senior product designer and frontend engineer.

Design a full web application UI for a social-media–style platform called
“Second London”.

DESIGN REFERENCE (MANDATORY)
Use BeReal as the primary design inspiration.
The UI must feel:
- feed-first
- minimal
- urgent
- human
- authentic
No flashy effects, no influencer-style UI, no vanity metrics.

PRODUCT IDEA (CONTEXT)
Second London is a micro-opportunity social network for London.
Users post short-lived “Moments” (needs, offers, free items, skill swaps).
Moments expire in 2–12 hours.
Other users apply.
Creator accepts.
Only then does chat unlock.
Trust and safety matter more than engagement metrics.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Mobile-first
- Dark-first UI
- No map-first experience
- No follower counts, likes, or reposts
- Time and urgency must always be visible
- Clean cards, fast scanning, low cognitive load

COLOR SYSTEM
- Background: #0B0B0F
- Card surface: #15151C
- Primary text: #FFFFFF
- Muted text: #A1A1AA
- Success / Verified: #22C55E
- Warning / Ending soon: #F97316
- Danger / Report: #EF4444
No gradients. No neon colors.

TYPOGRAPHY
- Font: Inter (system-ui fallback)
- Title: 20–22px semibold
- Card title: 16px medium
- Body text: 14px
- Meta text (time, distance): 12px
Hierarchy is more important than decoration.

APP LAYOUT
App shell:
- Top bar with app name + profile avatar
- Bottom navigation (mobile):
  - Feed
  - Ending Soon
  - Create
  - Inbox
  - Profile

Desktop:
- Left sidebar navigation
- Center feed column
- Optional right column for filters

FEED CARD DESIGN (CORE COMPONENT)
Each Moment card must include:
- Title (clear, short)
- Expiry countdown (e.g. “Ends in 42m”) — ALWAYS visible
- Approximate area (e.g. “Near Stratford”)
- Distance band (e.g. “<1 mi”, “1–2 mi”)
- Short description (max 2–3 lines)
- Reward label (£, Free, Swap, None)
- Trust badge (Level X, Verified if applicable)
- Primary action: Apply

Card rules:
- Rounded corners: 12px
- Padding: 16px
- Compact height
- No shadows or very subtle shadow
- Designed for fast scrolling

CREATE MOMENT FLOW
5-step vertical wizard:
1. Type: Need / Offer / Free / Swap
2. Title + description
3. Reward (cash / free / swap / none)
4. Area label + radius (text only, no map)
5. Expiry (2h / 4h / 8h / 12h) + Quiet Mode toggle

Use dot-based progress indicators.
Single-column, thumb-friendly.

QUIET MODE
- Applicants can only send a short template message (max 240 chars)
- No chat access before acceptance
- Full chat unlocks only after acceptance

CHAT UI
- Dark background
- Flat message blocks (no speech bubbles)
- Timestamps below messages
- System safety banner at top:
  “Meet in public places. Stay safe.”
No reactions, no typing indicators, no emojis spam.

PROFILE PAGE
- Avatar
- Display name
- Trust level badge (Level 0–5)
- Star rating
- Verified badge (if any)

Tabs:
- Moments created
- Completed moments
- Reviews

No followers. No likes. No social vanity metrics.

INTERACTIONS & MOTION
- Subtle fade-ins (100–150ms)
- Simple button press feedback
- No parallax
- No complex animations

FINAL GOAL
Produce a BeReal-style, feed-driven social UI
that feels fast, real, trustworthy, and built for
short-lived local interactions — not content creation.

Generate:
- Feed screen
- Moment card component
- Create Moment flow
- Chat screen
- Profile screen
All consistent with the above rules.
